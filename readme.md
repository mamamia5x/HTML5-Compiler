# HTML5 Compiler
The one thing I've always wanted to make was a compiler. I first tried with PHP, it worked well and did the job. But it was ugly and nothing special. You can find it [here](https://github.com/mamamia5x/Old-HTML5-Compiler). 

The Beta site, which is where I test new features, can be found [here](https://HTML-JS-CSS-Compiler.mamamia5x.repl.co).

The lastest relase, which you can use to download and run the project offline, can be found [here](https://github.com/mamamia5x/HTML5-Compiler/releases).

The lastest relase can be found [here](https://github.com/mamamia5x/HTML5-Compiler/releases), but please note that this might not work offline because most computers block the file write system.
